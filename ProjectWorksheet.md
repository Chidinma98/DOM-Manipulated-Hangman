## Project Description

This game will be a combination of Hangman and Wheel of Fortune. Three players take turns either guessing a letter or a word that matches the chosen word in the array.

If the user decides to  guess a letter and the letter is inside the word, the user gets a point. If the letter is not inside the word they lose a point.

However, the player can also choose to guess the word. In each case they risk losing or gaining 10 additional points depending on whether the word they guessed is correct.

The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the player hits restart game.

The player with the most points win.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min
My MVP is just a working hangman game that is able to compare letters and words to imputed values. 



#### MVP 

•	Function that Iterates through all the Players, depending on whose turn it is.
•	Button that allows the user to either solve the Puzzle or Simply guess	a letter.
•	If they choose to Solve the puzzle. Solve the Puzzle Function Runs
•	If they choose to guess a letter, Guess the letter Function Runs.
•	Another Function that Tallies up the Points. If they guess incorrectly their Points Go Back to Zero.
•	Once the word is Correct, the Game Resets and Another word is chosen from the Array


#### PostMVP 

Some additional features are that I can create a customizable number of players.



Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
