#### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges. It's up to you to use what you've learned to come up with a fun and interesting game.

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go.

As part of this project, you'll be required to present your project to your instructors and classmates in a "Science Fair" showcase. Your goal for this presentation is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking and presenting about your code (and have people play your game!)

Show us what you've got!

## Due Dates

Your proposal for this project, as outlined in the proposal section below, must be completed and ready to present for approval by:

**Tuesday, August 14th at 9:00 AM**

This assignment, as outlined below, must be complete in totality by:

**Monday, August 20th at 9:00 AM**.

## Requirements

#### Your game website must:

- Be a working, interactive, non-trivial game.
- Be deployed via GitHub pages.
- Include at least one CSS transition fired by a DOM event.
- Be styled with CSS.

#### Your code must:

- Be properly indented
- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names
- Be written with kebab-case CSS class names
- No console.log() or commented out code in final version

#### Your README must:

- Name of your project
- Brief description of the game
- A link to your deployed game

**Bonus**

- Include a "Tutorial Section" of this landing page (why: instructions help think through the "UX" of your project)

## Necessary Deliverables

#### For the proposal:
- A collection of wireframes - hand-drawn or digitally created - outlining the important pages of your site, as well as the critical states of your game (start state, play state(s) win state). As some games have many or infinite numbers of play states and win state, you can just provide a few simplified diagrams to convey the general idea.
- A proposal including:
	- A description of the game you'll be building with the objective described in non-technical language.
	- An explanation of the major problems you plan to face while implementing this game.
	- An explanation of how you foresee yourself solving the aforementioned problems.

#### For the game:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project (YOUR APP SHOULD BE LOCATED IN A SEPARATE STANDING REPO. DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub account.)
